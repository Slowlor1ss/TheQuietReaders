Two season tickets. One genius idea. Zero interest in a relationship. Until…

This book is the first in the Love of the Game series by Kandi Steiner and follows Gemma Mancini’s through the perfect plan to get her back into the dating scene, until Zach Bowen gives her an offer she just can’t turn down. This story perfectly encapsulates the angsty, messy process of falling in love when you both are healing from the past.

## Plot Points

Gemma Mancini is a control-freak. This is something that is set out on the first page of the prologue, where she discovers the devastating news that her husband is a cheater. The book details how she handles this *(and the shocking events after), *which allows us to resonate with Gemma immediately. The book doesn’t ease you in slowly, it dunks you in the deep end from the first sentence. In the first chapter, you meet Belle, who is by far my favourite character. She’s the typical loud and bossy best friend that is a fairly common archetype to these types of novels, but she does have a fiery personality and that is exactly what this story needed to push things along. After a lot of arguing back and forth, Gemma decides to take a different man to every football game of the season. It’s important to note to any non-american readers that this is American football, and throughout the book this is a central point that links all of the pieces together. I, personally, have never been into sports, but I think the way this book approached sport was very tolerable and beneficial for the plot. It gave the characters a central reason to do the things they did on a surface level, as well as being a consistent plot point throughout the entire story. I loved the way Kandi wove it into the novel while making it swallowable for a larger audience.  \
Both Gemma and Zach have past trauma’s that influence their decisions heavily through the story, leading to relatable mistakes and emotional depth for the reader. 


## Writing Style

The writing style allowed for a clear voice for each character in this dual-perspective novel that I really enjoyed. Gemma has a more anxious, controlling, and cutesy internal monologue, whereas Zach is more relaxed, calm, and lovable. This distinction definitely made me understand the characters on a deeper level and helped towards my hope for a happy ending. I also appreciated how their voices didn’t blur together - each chapter felt like stepping into a different emotional world, which made their misunderstandings and moments of connection feel more authentic. The contrast in their perspectives added a nice balance to the story, especially during the heavier scenes, because you could feel how differently they processed the same moment. This made the whole reading experience more immersive and gave the romance a more layered feel.


## What I Loved

One thing I really loved about this book was how naturally Gemma and Zach’s chemistry developed. It never felt forced or overly dramatic  - it was more of a slow, steady pull that made every interaction feel meaningful. I also adored the banter. Kandi Steiner has a real talent for writing dialogue that feels both sharp and intimate, and it makes even the quieter scenes feel alive. And honestly, Zach as a character is such a standout. He’s patient without being passive, charming without being cocky, and he brings this warm, grounding energy that balances Gemma’s chaos perfectly. Belle deserves an honourable mention too - she’s the kind of best friend character who actually adds something to the story rather than just filling space. Her presence pushes the plot forward in a way that feels organic, and she brings a lot of humour and heart to the heavier moments.


## What I Didn’t Love

Now, onto the hard-hitting criticisms. For me, the pacing of this book definitely feels off. The beginning is fast-paced, getting introduced in the middle of a serious situation. This fast-pace is kept up for the first 100 pages and then there seems to be a lull. Don’t get me wrong, things *are *happening, but it doesn’t feel as if it has any impact on the story. For me, there was a lack of suspense and no real stakes were ever established. This caused some struggle with fully encompassing myself in the world that Kandi had created because I never felt uncertain of the ending. I knew they would end up together because every time Gemma felt anxious, Belle would be there to save her* (which is what a best friend should do) *but it did feel almost unrealistic in the way it went about this. Predictability isn’t always bad, but here I found it softened the emotional payoff.


## Recommendation

I’d recommend *The Wrong Game* to anyone who loves a good sports romance with plenty of tension and heart. If you’re into slow burns, stubborn characters who are clearly a mess but trying their best, and a hero who shows up with quiet, steady devotion, this one hits the spot. It’s especially great if you like football actually mattering to the story instead of just being a cute backdrop. But if you prefer low‑angst romances or get impatient with heroines who keep their walls up for a long time, this might not be your vibe. For me, it worked because it blends humor, heartbreak, and character growth in a way that feels fun but still meaningful. \
This is also the first book in the series, with the next one centering on Belle which I am incredibly excited to read.
