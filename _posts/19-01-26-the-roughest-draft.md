This BookTok sensation blends creative partnership, emotional repression and the slow burn of unresolved, messy feelings. This novel leans into the fantasy of writing with someone who knows you better than you know yourself, and the complications of facing them again after everything falls apart.  It’s the kind of romance that isn’t built on grand gestures but on shared sentences, half-finished drafts, and the dreams of what could’ve been.

## Plot Points

Katrina Freeling and Nathan Van Huysen used to be the golden duo of the publishing world, co-writing a bestseller that defined their careers. Then something happened. Something big enough that they stop speaking, stop writing and pretend the other didn’t exist. Years later, they’re dragged back together because their contract still owes one final book, which means returning to the same little Florida house where everything between them originally blew up. This plot has so many potentials, between the forced proximity and the enemies-to-lovers tropes, and it lives up to the hype. These days, forced proximity storylines typically aren’t my favourite. They usually feel coerced and the author doesn’t take the time to establish why they have to be together. *However,* Emily Wibberley and Austin Siegemund-Broka really took the time to make it seem realistic and believable.  \
The story also digs into some really thoughtful themes beyond the tropes. One of the strongest is the idea of creative intimacy — how writing with someone becomes its own kind of relationship, full of trust, vulnerability and unspoken expectations. The book also explores ambition and identity, especially the pressure both characters feel to succeed on their own after building a career together. And, of course, communication sits at the heart of everything: the things they didn’t say, the assumptions they made, and the fear of being honest. All of this makes the romance feel deeper, more grounded and genuinely emotional.

## Writing Style 

The style of writing is warm, introspective and *occasionally a little indulgent*, but honestly, that fits the vibe of the story perfectly. It is a dual POV book, and there is a clear sense of who Katrina and Nathan are when they’re alone with their thoughts. They aren’t *just* characters in a romance novel. They are their own people with their own motivations and interests, and it is done really well. Katrina’s chapters feel tighter, more anxious and hyper-aware, as if she is attempting to edit her own thoughts. Nathan’s chapters feel looser and more emotionally honest. Their respective chapters don’t only tell you what they are thinking, but they show how they process the same moment, which makes you truly root for them.

## What I Loved

I am a sucker for dual POV, and I think *The Roughest Draft* nailed this. The switches between the two never feel gimmicky, or like they are switching between the characters *because they have to.* It feels purposeful, heartwarming and sweet. \
I also loved how *real* the characters feel. Katrina’s anxious overthinking and Nathan’s emotional softness make them feel like actual people rather than romance archetypes. Their reactions, their hesitations, their tiny moments of vulnerability, it all feels grounded and believable.  \
And the slow burn? Perfect. It’s not dragged out for drama; it’s slow because these two are genuinely terrified of confronting their past. Every lingering look, every almost-conversation, every writing session where they’re clearly saying more on the page than they can in person. It all builds this tension that feels realistic rather than manufactured. It’s the kind of romance where the quiet moments hit just as hard as the big ones, and that’s what makes it so satisfying. \
The imagery this book evokes isn’t too ‘in your face’, it trusts the reader to pay attention and use their own imagination on the exact details. I love when books give you some of the details of how a house looks, or evoke strong imagery through the feelings and monologues of the characters, rather than giving massive - almost list-seeming - descriptions that lack emotion.

## What I Didn’t Love

The first thing that comes to mind is the ending. The entire plot is a slow-burn romance, wrapped in miscommunications with a lot of internal monologue and thoughts. Then, at the ending, the pacing completely switches. Without creating spoilers, let me just say the story ends abruptly. I finished it, closed it and felt like I had whiplash from how quick the ending happened.  \
The miscommunication trope plays a big part in the story, and I found that some of the emotional beats repeated themself in the middle of it. It was still enjoyable because it was well-written, but I can definitely see some people getting frustrated with this.

I really wish the side characters had more depth to them, throughout the whole book they were used as plot devices, rather than fully fleshed out people. I didn’t particularly feel like they had a specific voice, or that they were there for any reason other than to move the story from A to B. \
I will also say, although the story does it well, the whole ‘reading a book about books’ trope feels safe - they know their readers like books and they aren’t taking a risk on an interesting narrative.

## Recommendation

I recommend this book to those that love a good enemies-to-lovers trope, especially with the slow-burn romance. It’s perfect for those of you out there that prefer a book without explicit sexual scenes in your books as well. The Roughest Draft does contain mature content, but it does not rely on it to further the narrative, nor does it ever get *too* explicit.
