*Deep End* is a college sport romance, full of angsty strife and steamy intimacy. This novel leans into everything the genre does best - tension, rivalry and emotional messes. It follows two athletes whose lives collide at exactly the wrong moment, creating a push‑and‑pull dynamic that’s addictive to watch unfold.

Plot Points

This book starts by dropping you straight into Scarlett Vandermeer’s head, and it’s messy in a way that immediately makes sense for the reader. The opening pages set the tone - overwhelmed, burnt out and trying to pretend she’s perfectly fine. Therapy becomes a big part of the story from there, not heavy-handedly, but as a steady thread where she slowly starts unpacking everything she has been avoiding.  \
Then she gets tangled up with her rival, Lukas Blomqvist, and the tension is immediate. They’re competitive in that “*I hate you but also why are you so attractive*” kind of way, and every interaction feels like it could turn into either an argument or a kiss. As the story goes on, the rivalry shifts - still sharp, still competitive, but now layered with chemistry they can’t ignore. The romance builds in that delicious slow‑burn way, full of heated banter, moments where they get *too* close and have to pretend it didn’t happen. Overall, it’s so much fun to watch it unfold.

Writing Style  \


Ali Hazelwood has a signature romance style of writing that I genuinely adore. She knows what story she wants to tell and she nails it every time. The first few chapters were, in my opinion, more difficult to get into than any of her other novels I have read, but I think that is because I usually don’t read sports romance too often. But once I was about 3-4 chapters in, I felt myself slipping into the world laid out on the page in front of me. Ali leans heavily into internal monologues, which works perfectly for a character who’s constantly overthinking, spiraling and trying *(badly)* to keep her walls up. The dialogue snaps in all the right places too. It’s sharp when the rivalry is at its peak, and softer when the romance starts creeping in. It’s funny, chaotic and very reminiscent of those silly college-life moments. Ali gives just enough exposition for us to understand the stakes, and relationships in the story, without too much repetition. When reading this, no scene felt like it was dragging on, or, on the opposite end, too short.  \

What I Loved

I adored the characters in this book. It spends a lot of time establishing Scarlett’s pressures and the way stress is manifesting in her life, and the emotional payoff for this as she begins to find relief - not only in Lukas - but by the changes in herself too, feels organic and impactful. This book also delves, lightly, into some stigmas around BDSM and other kinks, and the way that it touched that topic (which has the potential to be heavy) didn’t feel too unrealistic or shameful.  \
I will say, there are *a lot* of explicit scenes in this book, often involving the exploration of BDSM, and the way it makes an effort to show a realistic example of what it should look like - through the negotiation and enthusiastically expressed consent - really impressed me. *To be fair, this should be the standard in every piece of modern literature or media, but it, unfortunately, isn’t*. I also think the book has a lot of unintended comedy to me, as the characters are exploring their sexual desires, it nails the anxiety and fear of judgement that is felt in real life. I can physically put myself in their position, a stressed-burnt out college kid trying to figure out who they are even when it elicits uncomfortable emotions, and I think most of us would be able to do that too. 

What I Didn’t Love

Overall, I found the side characters, with the exception of 1 or 2, quite unremarkable. I'm the type of girl that loves some side character action, and wants to feel the depth of them even if it is something we never fully delve into. This book fell short of that. \
I also found that it failed to give me the description needed for it to have a lasting effect on my psyche. I went back and forth for a long time on what type of description it lacked, and I find that in many of the other books I read (*This Summer Will Be Different* in particular), they provide a sense of nostalgia and longing in their way of describing the details. I didn’t feel that in this story, which I do think is a missed opportunity as the topic of college is, probably, the best setting to elicit these types of emotion. 

Recommendation

This is a great book for those that want to handle some spice. It still doesn’t cross the line into dark romance, but the sexual scenes definitely edge closer to it than in any of Ali Hazelwood’s other books that I have read so far. The romance itself is endearing and very heartwarming - focusing on two young adults helping each other through the trials and tribulations of life.
